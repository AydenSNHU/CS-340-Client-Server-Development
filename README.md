# CS-340-Client-Server-Development

When you write a program, you want to ensure that your code is as modular as possible, and that there are no errors. Ensuring this lets you build on top of your code from previous times. Good code will last much longer and hold up better than code that is not well-thought out and is not maintainable, readable, and adaptable. After making just the CRUD module for the one project, I was able to use it again and again, allowing me to see that reusability that is in code. Approaching a problem as a computer scientist means to logically think about it and to create a generalized fix that is reusable in the future. Additionally, you are able to solve problems better the more problems that you solve, so if you solve more problems as a computer scientist, you will be able to better problem solve in the future. Computer scientists are the backbone for databases. They literally make it possible for companies to even hold a digital list of employee names and payroles in their systems. Without computer scientists, there is nothing. If I can continue to make my code maintainable, readable, adaptable, and reusable, all while training my problem-solving skills, I will be well off in the computer science world.
